# Random-Python

These are scraps of projects from JetBrains on my laptop. The one of interest is the RPG game.

RPG game is a colosseum turn-based, text-based fighting game. There is no plan to balance the game.

Main goal of the project is to practice using the class object. There were plans to have multiple enemies and potentially multiple allies, however it is too imbalanced right now.
The level and stats of the enemies scale with the player, but perhaps a little quicker than the player (think FFVIII).

Main.py is the original version where the basics were implemented.

Main_2.py is the version with additional features, such as resting and exp and so on.

Main_3.py is an unfinished attempt of fixing a bug where the player can spam commands and the game with continually execute it rather than read one and ignore the rest.

This project was made in 2018.
